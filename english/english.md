### This repository describes how I have been recovering from social anxiety disorder.

<br>

#### Naturally, I am not in remission yet, and the focus will be on describing my progress.

<br>

#### Who I am?
- Working as a software engineer in Tokyo.
- Diagnosed with social anxiety disorder when I was in university.
- Now, despite my difficulties, I manage to go to meetings and speak up like a normal member of society.


#### My own personality and traumas
<br>

I am a shy person by nature, and my earliest trauma is the memory of being laughed at (without malice) for an outlandish comment at a cram school I attended in elementary school.
<br>

After that, I spent my school years in elementary, junior high, and high school, avoiding public appearances. <br> 


I was so terrified of giving a 30-minute presentation in high school that I got through it by reading the manuscript verbatim with my hands trembling.<br>


In the university, I suffered from a fear of women, which made discussion lessons and the like painful.<br>

In addition, the number of public speaking engagements and presentations increased dramatically, and my depression worsened in my second year of university. I could not stop crying even when I was at home and not doing anything. At the same time, I couldn't get up from the bed and had continuous feelings of "I want to disappear" and "I want to be gone". For this reason, I went to see a psychosomatic doctor for the first time in my life.
