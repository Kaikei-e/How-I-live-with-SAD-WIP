# How do I live with "SAD", WIP

### This repository describes how I have been recovering from social anxiety disorder.

#### Naturally, I am not in remission yet, and the focus will be on describing my progress.

#### Who am I?
- Working as a software engineer in Tokyo.
- Diagnosed with social anxiety disorder when I was in university.
- Now, despite my difficulties, I manage to go to meetings and speak up like a normal member of society.
