## This repository describes how I have been recovering from social anxiety disorder.

<br>

### Naturally, I am not in remission yet, and the focus will be on describing my progress.

<br>

### I will write what I believe to be a cliché but a truth.<br>


- The only way to recover is to build up your confidence steadily, to accumulate small success stories that " I did it!", and to get small successes, making progress little by little. In this way, even if you feel like dying from a panic attack, you still have to increase your experience steadily.
- Also, keep your distance from people who despise you (not criticize you).
- It is essential to find people who affirm you and to have experiences that make you feel accepted by them.<br>

### Who am I?
- Working as a software engineer in Tokyo.
- Diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder when I was in university.
- Now, despite my difficulties, I manage to go to meetings and speak up like an ordinary member of society.


### My personality, my disease progress, and traumas
<br>

#### childhood


I am a shy person by nature, and my earliest trauma is the memory of being laughed at (without malice) for an outlandish comment at a cram school I attended in elementary school.
<br>

After that, I spent my school years in elementary, junior high, and high school, avoiding public appearances. <br> 


I was so terrified of giving a 30-minute presentation in high school that I got through it by reading the manuscript verbatim with my hands trembling.<br>

#### adolescence

In the university, I suffered from gynephobia, which made discussion lessons and the like painful.<br>

In addition, the number of public speaking engagements and presentations increased dramatically, and my depression worsened in my second year of university. I could not stop crying even when I was at home and not doing anything. At the same time, I couldn't get up from the bed and had persistent feelings of "I want to disappear" and "I want to be gone". For this reason, I went to see a psychosomatic doctor for the first time in my life.<br>

Since then, I have been visiting the hospital regularly. My initial diagnosis was "bipolar disorder," and I didn't even know the concept of "social anxiety disorder" at first. I thought it was just " shyness ". <br>

I managed to spend my days in a state of depression, but I had to look for a job in my third year of university. In the name of internship, I started the preparatory work to get a job offer from a company. Although I was a liberal arts graduate, I knew that sales and clerical jobs were not suitable for me due to my personality, so I started to work towards becoming a software engineer, which I was just interested in.<br>


I don't know what the situation is like overseas. Still, I feel that in Japan, people with a social anxiety disorder who are not aware of their condition are often dismissed as just "nervous" or "shy" and often blame themselves for not being able to do something so simple. Many of them blame themselves for not being capable of such an easy task. This is because I was one of them.<br>

That's why I went to multiple interviews for internship positions at IT companies. In all of them, I pushed myself to go to the interviews even though I had been feeling depressed for a month before, lost my appetite, and couldn't get out of bed." I care too much about myself." If I can't do this well, I won't be able to make it in the future." I went to the interview, relentlessly berating myself. I failed miserably and failed all the internship interviews, as you can probably guess. Of course, one of the reasons was that I had no experience and no skills, but I think the other reason was that I was too nervous to answer the questions properly.<br>

#### Sudden drop
<br>

I have already mentioned that I failed all three of my internship interviews, but from this point on, my symptoms quickly worsened. My depression got worse, and I couldn't sleep at night, throwing up everything I ate. Why did it become like this?<br>

It was due to anxiety. At that time, I had a horrible case of black-and-white thinking (or 01 thinking). I was knocked down to the depths of despair, following the order of thinking: "I'll fail even an internship interview," "I won't be able to find a job at a company," "I won't be able to live after graduating from university," and "I'll have to die in the wild.<br>
